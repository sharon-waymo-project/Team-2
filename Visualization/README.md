# Prediction Script

This directory contains the python code for visualizing the predictions generated by the Machine Learning model on the unseen data.

This file is mainly used to generate predictions using the VotingRegressor model that we trained in the VotingRegressor_GridSearch.ipynb file

## Input
For running the code in this file, we need 4 inputs:

1) The CSV file containing the predictions generated by the model (refer to the Prediction Script directory)
2) The CSV file containing the frame values of the unseen data
3) The video of the scenario

### Running the model:
Running this model is very easy as you just need to provide the path  of the inputs mentioned above, and the script can be run as it is.

NOTE: You will have to change the name of the file where visualization will be generated.

### Runtime of the model:
The runtime of this script is about 2-3 minutes.

### Dependencies:
There are multiple Python libraries that are necessary to run this model. They are:
1) Pandas
2) Numpy
3) cv2
4) matplotlib

### Outputs:
After running the code, a video containing the visualization of the scenario of the car along with the graphs of predicted accelerations and true accelerations will be shown.
